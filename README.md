# Quarantine Challenge

> During the quarantine I challenged myself to pick out some designs on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) (or wherever) and then try to implement them in Swift to keep myself busy. I did not set myself any requirements in quality or anything like that. The only thing is that I have to be able to implement it in a day or less (depending on how much time I have). Status will then be pushed to GitHub without further ado. Projects may or may not be developed further later.
